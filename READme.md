a full stack form.
MY first full stack website; which include a frontend backend and a database;
enter the details and the details will be stored in the ppostgresql database.. 
this is runs on local server only after you have download it in and do the steps

create a folder project
inside put the index.js, package-lock and package file and create two folder named public and view
put the ejs file in view and css file in public 
then install the node modules using npm i and search localserver:3000 to run the site

well, this was pretty noobish and will try putting it in my domain when I will buy one.
the details in the form will be stored in my database table
